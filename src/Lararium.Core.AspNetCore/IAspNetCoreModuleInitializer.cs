        /// 1. Define: Use a generic 'IPermissionDefinitionContext' in the Core project to declare strings like "Billing.View".
        /// 2. Store: Create an 'IPermissionStore' to manage these definitions and their relationships to roles/users.
        /// 3. Check: Implement an 'IPermissionChecker' service that can be used anywhere.
        /// In the Web layer, you would then create a 'PermissionRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement' 
        /// that bridges these generic permissions to the ASP.NET Core Policy system automatically.
